# Pipelines repository for automated NGS data analysis.  

This repository is dedicated to pipelines that were developed in python 3.7 for an automated bioinformatic analysis of NGS data. 

These pipelines are alpha versions which were tested and refined using datasets of COVID-19 sequences from GOG-UK. 

Here, we included versions of pipelines that are runnable in command line and a version that includes a complete command line interface.
