# Pipelines repository for automated NGS data analysis.  

This repository is dedicated to pipelines that were developed in python 3.7 for an automated bioinformatic analysis of NGS data. 

These pipelines are alpha versions which were tested and refined using datasets of COVID-19 sequences from GOG-UK. 

Documented versions of the pipelines were included and one complete command line interface tool was also included.
